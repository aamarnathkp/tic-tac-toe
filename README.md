# Tic-Tac-Toe with Life System 🎮

A fun twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game! This is a **2-player** game where each player starts with **3 lives**. The game continues until one player's lives are reduced to zero.

## 🧠 Game Concept

-   Traditional 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.
-   Two players take turns: **Player X** and **Player O**.
-   A match ends when someone wins or it results in a draw.
-   Each loss or draw affects the players' lives:
    -   **Loser of a round** loses **1 life**.
    -   **In case of a draw**, **both players** lose **1 life**.
-   The game continues until **one player's lives reach 0** — that player loses the game.

## 🎮 Game Instructions

1. Players take turns placing their marks (**X** or **O**) on the grid.
2. The first player to get **three marks in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the round.
3. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the round is a **draw**.
4. If a round ends in a draw, **both players lose 1 life**.
5. The game resets the board after each round and continues with updated life counts.
6. The game ends when **one player’s life becomes 0** — that player **loses** the game.
7. Have fun and good luck! 🍀
